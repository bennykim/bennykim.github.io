Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.
Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.
You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

Ex 1: 
```
Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
```

Answer :
```
var sortArrayByParityII = function(A) {
    var result = new Array(A.length)
    var even = 0
    var odd = 1

    for (var i=0; i<A.length; i++) {
      if (A[i] % 2 == 0) {
        result[even] = A[i]
        even += 2
      } else {
        result[odd] = A[i]
        odd += 2
      }
    }

    return result
}
```
