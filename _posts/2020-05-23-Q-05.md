You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

'A' : Absent.
'L' : Late.
'P' : Present.

A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

## Answer :
```
var checkRecord = function(s) {
  var n = 0

  for (var i=0; i<s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] === 'A' && ++n > 1) return false
    if (s[i] === 'L' && s[i + 1] === 'L' && s[i + 2] === 'L') return false
  }

  return true
};
