title: The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix
Algorithms: algorithms
layout: post
---

Given a m * n matrix mat of ones (representing soldiers) and zeros (representing civilians), return the indexes of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row i is weaker than row j, if the number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j, or they have the same number of soldiers but i is less than j. Soldiers are always stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always ones may appear first and then zeros.

Ex 1: 
```
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 2 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 2 
row 4 -> 5 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]
```

Ex 2:
```
Input: mat = 
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]], 
k = 2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 1 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 1 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]
```


Answer :
```
var kWeakestRows = function(mat, k) {
    var stack = []

    for (var i=0; i < mat.length; i++) {
      var temp = mat[i].filter(t => t == 1).length
      stack.push({'idx' : i, 'value': temp})
    }

    return stack.sort((a, b) => {
      return a.value === b.value ? a.idx - b.idx : a.value - b.value
    }).slice(0, k).map(s => s.idx)
}
```
