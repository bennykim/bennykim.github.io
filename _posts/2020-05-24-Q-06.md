Given an array of integers arr, a lucky integer is an integer which has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return a lucky integer in the array. If there are multiple lucky integers return the largest of them. If there is no lucky integer return -1.

***

### Ex 1:
```
Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The only lucky number in the array is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.
```

### Ex 2: 
```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.
```

### Ex 3: 
```
Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array.
```

### Ex 3: 
```
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 7
```

## Answer :
```
var findLucky = function(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((a, x) => {
    a[x] = (a[x] || 0) + 1
    return a
  },[])
  .filter((x, i)=> x == i)
  .sort((a, b) => b-a)[0] || -1
}
```
