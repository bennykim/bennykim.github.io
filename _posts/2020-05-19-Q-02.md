title: Last Stone Weight

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

### Ex 1:
```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
```

## Answer :
```
var lastStoneWeight = function(stones) {
  while (stones.length > 1) {
    stones.sort((a, b) => b - a)
    stones.push(stones[0] - stones[1])
    stones.splice(0, 2)
  }

  return stones
};
```
