You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

***

### Ex 1:
```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

### Ex 2: 
```
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

## Answer :
```
var countCharacters = function(words, chars) {
    return words.reduce((temp, item) => {
      var count = 0
      var text = chars

      for (var char of item) {
        if (text.indexOf(char) > -1) {
          text = text.replace(char, '')
          count++

          if (item.length === count) {
            return temp + count
          }
        } else {
          break;
        }
      }

      return temp
    }, 0)
}
```
